My Uzi weigh a ton son, carry it
My Uzi weigh a ton son, carry it
My Uzi weigh a ton son, carry it
Ton son, carry it, ton son, carry it

Yo, my Uzi weigh a ton son, carry it

Watch-watch me body rhymes just to bury 'em
They-they pose some threat but we scarier
What you call privilege, we call 'em barriers
My Uzi weigh a ton son, carry it

You fucked with the wrong generation
(Yeah you did)
You fucked with the wrong generation
(You know you did)
You fucked with the wrong generation
Yeah! You fucked with the wrong generation

My Uzi weigh a ton, son, carry it
My Uzi weigh a ton, son, carry it
My Uzi weigh a ton, son, carry it
Ton, son, carry it, ton, son, carry it
